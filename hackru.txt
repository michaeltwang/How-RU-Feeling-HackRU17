
We have developed an Android app called "How RU Feeling?" that displays buttons with different moods on them. 

Clicking on one of seven mood buttons (paired with a suitable mood image) sends you to a Rutgers-related URL link to fit, well, your mood! 
Examples:
Feeling sleepy? You'll be sent to the RWBJ Sleep Center website to register for an appointment.
Feeling unmotivated? You'll be sent to the Rutgers 250 anniversary video that they play at orientation to give you some inspiration.
We also have an "Emergency" button that sends you to a Rutgers counseling website with contact information for various problems.

How RU Feeling? also has a social aspect to it!
It has built-in SMS messaging to share your moods with friends as well as the URLs you yourself were directed to.
We planned to implement a notification system to remind you to do this, and we also wanted to have the URL
autogenerate in the text message input, but sadly we did not have time to do this.

The Spotify API is used as well to play music to fit the mood. Implementing the Spotify playlist took a really long time
and headache and yet is not the prominent aspect of the app. It isn't implemented with the rest of the app, it's separate
because Spotify was the original idea and was scrapped. We were thinking about having background music play, but we again 
didn't have time to implement this. So if you find some crazy Spotify API stuff in our code and you're wondering why it's 
there, now you know!

Thank you for taking the time to look at our app! #Rutgers spirit!
